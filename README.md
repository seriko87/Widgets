# Rapid Info Web Application

After several small and tutorial web applications I decided to do my own web application. I always have visited same webpages to check daily updates like sport results, newws, crypto prices, etc. but it is hassle to check all those different pages. I first tried to use windows widgets but it is limited with only their list so I decided to make my own widgets application. 

note: since some APIs are paid I had to remove some of my original widgets(crypto, sports). Actively looking for good free ones.
