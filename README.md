# Rapid Info Web Application

After several small apps and tutorial web applications I decided to do my web application. I always have visited the same web pages to check daily updates like sport results, news, crypto prices, etc. but it is a hassle to check all those different pages. I first tried to use windows widgets but it is limited to only their list so I decided to make my own widgets application.

Note: since some APIs are paid I had to remove some of my original widgets(crypto, sports). Actively looking for good free ones.
